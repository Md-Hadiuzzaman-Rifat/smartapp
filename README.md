What have I learn from the project:
1. firstly I have to install Vite not react.
2. I cant use bam rules in where I use scss.
3. bam nested not working like,

body{
    font:{
        size:24px;
    }
}     //*****will work****** where as

.header{
    logo{

    }
}
4. I will use module.scss
5. css module doesn`t support - only support _ . {`${logo-create}`}. It would be {${logo_create}}
